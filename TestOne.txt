Change in feature branch

Starting from this line, any change should only be in dev or rel, not master.
First dev change.

the above 2 lines made it into master by mistake.

I want to merge this from dev to rel, not master.

This change is made in master, should not be in dev or rel before merging down.
Now that the conflict is resoved, this change should be in dev.
